## Selected Data Science Writing

<div class="aside">

These blogs represent interesting topics that presented themselves
during an operational project.

### Writing Efficient Code - Part 1

<https://dscoe.org> (CAC Enabled)

<https://github.com/nuhorchak/blogs/tree/master/writing_efficient_code_p1>

2020

-   1 of 3 part blog discussing how to write optimal code. This section
    focuses on the basic data constructs used in the R programming
    language, and how they can be used to write better (faster) code.

### Writing Efficient Code - Part 2

<https://dscoe.org> (CAC Enabled)

<https://github.com/nuhorchak/blogs/tree/master/writing_efficient_code_p2>

2020

-   2 of 3 part blog discussing how to write optimal code. This section
    focuses on the basic data constructs used in the python programming
    language, and how they can be used to write better (faster) code.

### Writing Efficient Code - Part 3

<https://dscoe.org> (CAC Enabled)

<https://github.com/nuhorchak/blogs/tree/master/writing_efficient_code_p3>

2020

-   3 of 3 part blog discussing how to write optimal code. This section
    compares R and Python, and discusses how utilizing the native data
    constructs in each language gains efficiency, speed, and memory
    usage.

## Selected Reserach

### Analysis of Incomplete SOCOM Selection Data

Air Force Instituite of Technology

Wright Patterson AFB, OH

2018 - 2017

-   Research for my masters thesis entailed supervised learning method
    for personnel selection.
-   Additonal research necessary to handle sparse data, delved deep into
    imputation methods and theory, to facilitate data completion.
